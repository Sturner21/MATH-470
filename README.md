This repository is a coordination and storage location for projects and files pertaining to my senior capstone class in Bayesian Data Analysis. This project was graciously overseen by [James Parson Ph.D.](https://www.hood.edu/academics/faculty/james-parson)

## Packages
The main textbook for this course was [*Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). The examples he provides are in *R* and utilize his package [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking). A guide for installation is available [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rethinking/versions/2.13), because it is only available on his GitHub repository.
